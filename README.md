# Copa Dor Hospital
Creation of **POC** for the **company IPNet**, in relation to the accreditation of new physicians in the network of **Copa Dor Hospital**.

**This repository** was created to **demonstrate the potential of my knowledge in front-end development**. **So do not wait for a complete system.**

# Starting
Before cloning the project, make sure you have all the tried and tested technologies below.

**Prerequisites**
- [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/)

After all the technologies above installed and with their proper configurations, it is time to clone the project and follow the steps below.

**Installing the Modules**
```
$ yarn install
```
This command will install all existing dependencies in the `package.json` file and the `node_modules` directory will be created along with all the modules within it.

# What is working?

**There are three screens, which are:**

- `Validation.html`

  This is the main screen (`index.html`). In this screen will be confirmed and validated the pre-registration code sent to the doctor's email.

- `process.html`

  After validating the pre-registration code, the doctor will be forwarded to this screen, where it is only an informational on how the accreditation process works.

- `process-steps.html`

  After you continue to the process.html page, the doctor may check the registration form for your accreditation. Where they have **5 steps of the accreditation process**.

**The 5 steps of the accreditation process are:**

- **Step 1 - Registration Form:**
 
   The doctor must inform you of your personal information, curriculum and application category. Soon the commercial information is obligatory, but in case the doctor wishes to fill it, it will become obligatory.

- **Step 2 - Sending documents:**

  The doctor must insert the required mandatory documents, such as: Identity Card, CRM, Titles and optional vouchers, among others.

- **Step 3 - Analysis and Approval:**

  The physician should wait for the analysis of the documentation sent by the competent organ to proceed.

- **Step 4 - Signing and Accreditation:**

  The physician should sign a digitial document of the letter of performance and accreditation to the clinical staff of the hospital.

- **Step 5 - Password Access:**

  After all 4 previous steps have been successfully completed, the doctor will receive your password to access the hospital system in your email.

**Note:** 

Since it is a **POC to demonstrate my abilities**, the following **attention** should be given:

- **No type of data validation**

- **Only the first step mentioned above is developed**
